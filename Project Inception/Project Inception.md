Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    The Team Caiman Lizard Project will be following the architecture style for ASP.NET Core, along with Agile principles.git branch Our use of scrum will mean that we will build our software in a dynamic and iterative approach. We are choosing to work in sprints that will occur every 2 weeks, while having different meetings throughout. At the end of each sprint, our software will be updated and deployed to Azure. We will achieve this by using a few communication resources including Discord and Jira, which will give us the capabilities of working in an Agile environment.

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    Our project is for individuals who are looking for an entertaining website to connect with their friends and community over TV shows and movies. The Social Watch Party is an application that allows users to watch shows simultaneously, without having to be in the same place. It also allows users to share what they are watching, their thoughts, and ratings for shows. Users will have a profile, where they can see their past watched shows, upcoming shows, and posts created. This feature benefits the entertainment of users and their ability to find new interesting shows on all streaming platforms. Unlike other movie platforms, Social Watch Party will have a major focus on the social media aspect, making it user friendly and more interactive, allowing the user to easily access information about shows and connect with their friends online, simultaneously.
