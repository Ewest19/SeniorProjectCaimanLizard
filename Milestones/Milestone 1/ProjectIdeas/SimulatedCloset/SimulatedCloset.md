# Virtual Character Creator using DALL-E 2 🎮👨‍💼👩‍💼

### Overview
The goal of this project is to create a preview of the user given proposed changes to their appearances using DALL-E 2, an image generator. For example, a user would be able to see how they would look like if had a different hairstyle. This would function similar to 'character customization' found in the popular game *The Sims*. 🎮🧑‍🎨

### Features
- **Customizable Avatar**: Users will upload their own images, and DALL-E 2 will use them as a reference to generate a virtual avatar to serve as a baseline. From this, changes can be made to the avatar to serve as preview for appearance changes. 📷

- **Digital Closet**: Users will be able to catalog their clothing and accessories digitally. This digital closet will also serve as the visual database that users can utilize to build their avatar.

- **Integrated Browsing**: The app will be able to browse from within the app to access items from their favorite shopping sites. 

- **Shareable**: Users will be able to share their generated outfits with friends and family for inspiration. 🤝💬
